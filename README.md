learning html
* **Empty tags** html (no closing tags) e.g; <br>, <hr>

* A **tooltip** is  a small pop-up box that appears when a user hovers over an element, providing additional information about that element. You can create tooltips using the title attribute, CSS hover effects, or JavaScript libraries like Bootstrap for more advanced features.

* **Single/double quotes -** Double quotes around attribute values are the most common in HTML, but single quotes can also be used. e.g; <p title='John "ShotGun" Nelson'>, or <p title="John 'ShotGun' Nelson">

* **<hr> tag** defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a ***horizontal rule***. The <hr> element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page
* **<pre>** defines preformatted text. The text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it ***preserves both spaces and line breaks***.
* **Formatting elements** were designed to display special types of text:

*<b>* - Bold text
*<strong>* - Important text (display - bold)
*<i>* - Italic text
*<em>* - Emphasized text (display - italics)
*<mark>* - Marked / highlighted text
*<small>* - Smaller text
*<del>* - Deleted text from a document (Browsers will usually strike a line through deleted text)
*<ins>* - Inserted text into a document (underlined)
*<sub>* - Subscript text
*<sup>* - Superscript text

* **Quotations**

***<blockquote>*** - a section that is quoted from another source. Browsers usually indent <blockquote> elements. e.g, <blockquote cite="link">text/paragraph</blockquote>

*<q>* - short quotation.Browsers normally insert quotation marks around the quotation.

*<abbr>* - an abbreviation or an acronym, e.g, "CSS", "Mr." Tip: Use the global title attribute to show the description for the abbreviation/acronym when you mouse over the element.( <p>The <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> was founded in 1948.</p> )

*<address>* - the contact information for the author/owner of a document or an article. The contact information can be an email address, URL, physical address, phone number, social media handle, etc. The text in the <address> element usually renders in italic, and browsers will always add a line break before and after the <address> element.

*<cite>* - title of a creative work, e.g., a book. A person's name is not the title of a work. usually renders in italic.

*<bdo>* for Bi-Directional Override - overrides the current text direction. e.g right to left (<bdo dir="rtl">This text will be written from right to left</bdo> )


* **Comments written as** *<!-- Write your comments here -->*

**-***not displayed* in the browser, but they can help document your HTML source code.

-You can place notifications and reminders in your HTML code

\-*hide content* temporarily, even more than one line. Great for debugging HTML, because you can comment out HTML lines of code, one at a time, to search for errors.

\-*Hide Inline Content* - to hide parts in the middle of the HTML code. (<p>This <!-- great text --> is a paragraph.</p>

* **Colors** - specified with predefined color names, or with RGB, HEX, HSL, RGBA, or HSLA values.
